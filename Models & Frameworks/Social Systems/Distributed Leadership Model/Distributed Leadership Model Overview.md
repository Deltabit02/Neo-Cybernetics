# Distributed Leadership Model Overview

## Introduction

Distributed leadership represents a move away from hierarchical top-down models to a more collaborative structure where influence and decision-making are shared across multiple individuals. 

Implementing a distributed leadership mindset allows organizations to harness the diverse skills and perspectives of their entire workforce, helping people to conceive power as a resource that can be shared and molded for the benefit of the group, rather than a finite commodity to be hoarded.

Leadership becomes an emergent property of the whole system that is embodied by each single individual, rather than the sole responsibility of those in formal managerial or strategic roles. 

This creates an agile and adaptive environment that fosters continuous growth, well-suited to decentralized organizations and holocracies.

By empowering employees to take initiative and drive progress in a bottom-up fashion, distributed leadership unlocks greater innovation, engagement, and organizational resilience. This approach aligns well with decentralized governance, as it provides a framework for shared ownership and participation aligned with broader organizational objectives and values.

## The Alchemic Roles

In the context of the distributed leadership model, we present a triadic structure, comprising three interdependent leadership roles, enabling rapid information flow, agile decision-making, and harmonious conflict resolution. 

Such roles are:

- The Keepers, responsible for information
- The Bearers, responsible for innovation
- The Navigators, responsible for impact

These three core roles can operate either on a strategic or operational level strategy or operations of a project, and the nature of the tasks that will have to be carried out depends on the context and the size and context of the project they work on. 

By operating within a common organizational context, the people embodying such roles will share an organizational identity, an organizational culture and resources.

By adopting a triadic structure, communications can be frequent and efficient and decisions can be made quickly by gathering perspectives and reaching a consensus. 

If disagreement arises, there is an inherent majority to resolve issues constructively, although the group has to remain mindful of what it means to break the balance when it comes to decision making. 

This format will be tested to demonstrate that it is highly scalable, improving it in a way so that triads can be replicated across teams, cohorts and departments while remaining small enough for coordination. 

Members can flexibly cover for each other's responsibilities in the case of absence, drawing on shared context from their interconnection. 

With each triad operating in trust and alignment, this structure creates an adaptable environment where information, decisions, and conflict can be managed smoothly even as the organization grows. 

The reciprocity within each unit allows for decentralization without sacrificing cohesion.
